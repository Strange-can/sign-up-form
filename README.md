Recently learnt how to style and create forms.
I will be creating and designing a sign up form that generally looks like <a href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a>.
This task is from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>

Goal: 
1. Style the page to look like the sign up form above through vanilla CSS
2. Create a HTML form section that validates whether user has given data for required fields
3. Ensure user's password is strong enough by employing the `pattern` attribute
4. Practice atomic commits
